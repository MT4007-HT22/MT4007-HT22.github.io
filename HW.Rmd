Six homework assignments are given on every Monday and should be solved and uploaded in your GitHub repository until Sunday **23:59**. On Monday morning, there is a round of peer review where you give and receive feedback to/from one fellow student. If necessary, you can then revise your solution. Final deadline for submission of the homework is on the following Tuesday 18:00. The tasks should be solved individually.
