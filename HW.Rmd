Six homework assignments should be solved and uploaded on GitHub at the latest **23:59** on their respective date of deadline. These should be solved individually. The assignments also involves peer review of another students solution - the deadline for this is the Wednesday following the Sunday deadline. Further information about the student peer review is typically provided at
the [nyhetsforum](https://kurser.math.su.se/mod/forum/view.php?id=76566) of kurser.math.su.se.
